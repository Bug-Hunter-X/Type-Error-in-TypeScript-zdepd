This repository contains a demonstration of a common type error in TypeScript. The bug.ts file contains a function that adds two numbers. However, when we try to add a string to a number, the compiler throws an error. The bugSolution.ts file contains a solution to this problem. In the solution file, we check if both arguments are numbers before performing the addition. This prevents the compiler from throwing an error.
